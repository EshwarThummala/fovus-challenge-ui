# Fovus Challenge UI

This is a simple full-stackÂ web application developed with AWS, React, and Flowbite Tailwind CSS. It demonstrates my understanding of numerous AWS services, including EC2, Lambda, API Gateway, Cognito, DynanoDB, IAM, and a few others. Additionally, it demonstrates my proficiency in the React Library. The project's functionality is simple: take some input data and a text file, then append the input text content to the input file. This needs to be done using various AWS services.
